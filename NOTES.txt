I guess bash is not necessary after all.
Applescript can handle everything here.

//
What does it need to handle?
//
- Closing previous Chromium instances.
- Starting new Chromium instances using args.
- Each Chromium instances should load discord
- Each Chromium instance should have its own
account that it should log in with.
- Each Chrome / Discord instance should connect to
local audio system.

Discord convo with many accounts, all listening for silence and producing sound


You need lots of accounts and an audio device with many channels of in and out that can be routed,
perhaps you’d need multiple audio devices (virtual)? They’re all listening to shared room, waiting
for silence and interruption.

Craig records each audio channel separately and will be essential to this:

open -a "Google Chrome" --args --profile-directory=Default

If can’t use Chromium instances, may need to access Discord directly instead:
